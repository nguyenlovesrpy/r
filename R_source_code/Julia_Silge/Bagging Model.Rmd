<font size = "10"> BAGGING WITH TIDYMODELS AND TIDYTUESDAY ASTRONAUT MISSIONS </font>

Lately I've been publishing screencasts demonstrating how to use the tidymodels framework, from first steps in modeling to how to evaluate complex models. Today's screencast focuses on bagging using this week's TidyTueday dataset on astronaut missions

Here is the code I used in the video, for those who prefer reading instead of or in addition to video


## Explore the data

- Our modeling goal is to use bagging (bootstrap aggregation) to model the duration of astronaut missions from this week's TidyTuesday dataset.

Let's start by reading in the data and check out what the top spacecraft used in orbit have been.


```{r}

suppressMessages(library(tidyverse))
suppressMessages(library(tidymodels))
theme_set(theme_light())

```

```{r}

astronauts <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-07-14/astronauts.csv")

astronauts %>% count(in_orbit, sort = TRUE)


```

How has the duration of missions changed over time? 


```{r}

astronauts %>% mutate(
               year_of_mission = 10*(year_of_mission %/% 10),
               year_of_mission = factor(year_of_mission)
) %>% 
               ggplot(aes(x = year_of_mission, y = hours_mission, fill = year_of_mission, color = year_of_mission)) + geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.2, size = 1.5, show.legend = FALSE) + scale_y_log10() + labs(x = NULL, y  = 'Duration of mission in hours')

```

This duration is what we want to built a model to predict, using the other information in this per-astronaut-per-mission dataset. Let's get ready for modeling next, by bucketing some of spacecraft together (such as all the space shuttle missions) and taking the logarithm of the mission length

```{r}

astronauts_df <- astronauts %>% 
               select(
                              name, mission_title, hours_mission, military_civilian, occupation, year_of_mission, in_orbit
               ) %>% 
               mutate(
                   in_orbit = case_when(
                                  str_detect(in_orbit, '^Salyut') ~ 'Salyut',
                                  str_detect(in_orbit, '^STS') ~ 'STS',
                                  TRUE ~ in_orbit
                   ), occupation = str_to_lower(occupation)
               ) %>% 
               filter(hours_mission > 0) %>% 
               mutate(hours_mission = log(hours_mission)) %>% na.omit()

```

It may make more sense to perform transformation like taking the logarithm of the outcome during data cleaning, before feature engineering and using and tidymodels packages like recipes. This kind of transformation is deterministic and can cause problems for tuning and resampling.

## Build a model

We can start by loading tidymodels metapackage, and splitting our data into training and testing sets

```{r}

library(tidymodels)

set.seed(123)
astro_split <- initial_split(astronauts_df, strata = hours_mission)

astro_train <- training(astro_split)
astro_test <- testing(astro_split)

```

Next, let's preprocess our data to get it ready for modeling 

```{r}

astro_recipe <- recipe(hours_mission ~., data= astro_train) %>%
               update_role(name, mission_title, new_role = 'id') %>% 
               step_other(occupation, in_orbit, threshold = 0.005, other = 'Other') %>% 
               step_dummy(all_nominal(), -has_role('id'))

```


Let's walk through the steps in this recipe 

- First, we must tell the ``recipe()`` what our model is going to be (using a formula here) and what data we are using 
- Next, update the role for the 2 columns that are not predictors or outcome. This way, we can keep them in the data for identification later
- There are a lot of different occupations and spacecraft in this dataset, so let's collapse some of the less frequently occuring levels into an "Other" category, for each predictor
- Finally, we can create indicator variables 

We're going to use this recipe in a ``workflow`` so we don't need to stress about whether to ``prep()`` or not 

```{r}

astro_wf <- workflow() %>% 
               add_recipe(astro_recipe)

astro_wf

```

For this analysis, we are going to build a bagging, bootstrap aggregating model. This is an ensembling and model averaging method that

- improves accuracy and stability
- reduces overfitting and variance

In tidymodels, you can create bagging ensemble models with baguette, a parsnip - adjacent package. The baguette functions create new bootstrap training sets by sampling with replacement and then fit a model to each new training set. These models are combined by averaging the predictions for the regression case, like what we have here (by voting, for classification)

Let's make 2 bagged models one with decision trees and oen with MARS models 

```{r}

library(baguette)

tree_spec <- bag_tree() %>% 
               set_engine('rpart', times = 25) %>%
               set_mode('regression')

tree_spec

```

```{r}

mars_spec <- bag_mars() %>%
               set_engine('earth', times = 25) %>% 
               set_mode('regression')

mars_spec

```

Let's fit these models to the training data 

```{r}

tree_rs <- astro_wf %>% add_model(tree_spec)%>%
               fit(astro_train)

tree_rs

```


```{r}

mars_rs <- astro_wf %>% add_model(mars_spec) %>%
               fit(astro_train)

mars_rs


```

The models return aggregated variable importance scores, and we can see that the spacecraft and year are importance in both models 

## Evaluate model

Let's evaluate how well these two models did by evaluating performance on the test data 

```{r}

test_rs <- astro_test %>% bind_cols(predict(tree_rs, astro_test))%>%
               rename(.pred_tree = .pred) %>% 
bind_cols(predict(mars_rs, astro_test))%>%
               rename(.pred_mars = .pred)

test_rs


```


We can use the ``metric()`` function from yardstick for both sets of predictions 

```{r}

test_rs %>%
               metrics(hours_mission, .pred_tree)

```


```{r}

test_rs %>% metrics(hours_mission, .pred_mars)

```

Both models performed pretty similarly

Let's make some new astronauts to understand the kinds of predictions out bagged tree model is making

```{r}
new_astronauts <- crossing(
               in_orbit = fct_inorder(c("ISS", "STS", "Mir", "Other")),
               military_civilian = 'civilian',
               occupation = 'Other',
               year_of_mission = seq(1960, 2020, by =10),
               name = 'id', mission_title = 'id')%>% 
               filter(
                              !(in_orbit == 'ISS' & year_of_mission < 2000),
                              !(in_orbit == 'Mir' & year_of_mission < 1900),
                              !(in_orbit == 'STS' & year_of_mission < 2010),
                              !(in_orbit == 'STS' & year_of_mission < 1980)
               )

new_astronauts


```

Let's start with the decision tree model 

```{r}

new_astronauts %>% bind_cols(predict(tree_rs, new_astronauts)) %>%
               ggplot(aes(x = year_of_mission, y = .pred, color = in_orbit)) + geom_line(size = 1.5, alpha = 0.7) + geom_point(size = 2) + labs(x = NULL, y = 'Duration of mission in hours (predicted, on log scale)', color = NULL, title = 'How did the duration of astronauts missions chaneg over time?', subtitle = 'Predicted using bagged decision tree model')

```

What about the MARS model? 

```{r}

new_astronauts %>% bind_cols(predict(mars_rs, new_astronauts)) %>% 
               ggplot(aes(x= year_of_mission, y = .pred, color = in_orbit)) + geom_line(size = 1.5, alpha = 0.7) + geom_point(size = 2) + labs(
                              x = NULL, y = 'Duration of mission in hours (predicted, on log scale)',
                              color = NULL, title = 'How did the duration of astronauts mission change over time?', subtitle = ' Predicted using bagged MARS model')
               


```

You can realy get a sense of how these 2 kinds of models work from the differences in these plots (tree vs splines with knots), but from both, we can see that missions to space stations are longer , and missions in that "Other" category change characteristics over time pretty dramatically
